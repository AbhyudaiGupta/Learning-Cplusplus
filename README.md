# C++ Learning Journey - BTech First Year

## About
This repository contains my C++ programming practice as a BTech First Year student, starting from basics and moving towards Data Structures and Algorithms.

## What's Inside
- **Learning-stage/** – Basic C++ learning done via College Wallah with hands-on programs
- **Loops And Pattern/** – Practice problems focusing on loops, pattern printing, and number logic

## What I've Learned So Far

- ✅ Variables and constants
- ✅ Data types (int, float, double, char, bool)
- ✅ Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
- ✅ Arithmetic operations and expressions
- ✅ File I/O setup for competitive programming (`#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE`)
- ✅ Operator precedence and associativity
- ✅ Typecasting (int to float, char to int, implicit vs explicit)
- ✅ Mixed-type arithmetic (operations with int and float)
- ✅ Conditional statements (if, if-else, else if, ternary operator)
- ✅ Using ternary operator for compact checks
- ✅ Loop constructs (for, while, do-while)
- ✅ Basic algorithms for palindrome, digit operations, and number comparison

## Programs Completed

- **Arithmetic & Basics**
  - AreaOfCircle.cpp: Calculates area of a circle
  - areaOfSquare.cpp: Calculates area of a square
  - float.cpp: Demonstrates float operations
  - SimpleIntrest.cpp: Calculates simple interest
  - OddEven.cpp: Checks if a number is odd or even
  - AbsoluteValue.cpp: Finds absolute value
  - RoundOfMarks.cpp: Demonstrates rounding and truncation (float to int conversion)
  - GradingSystem.cpp: Assigns grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F) based on marks with input validation
  - TeamComparison.cpp: Compares two teams ("Dominator" vs "Everule") and prints the winner based on their scores
  - 3numFight.cpp: Determines the largest among three numbers, handles all-equal and tie cases
  - SumOfNumbers.cpp: Sums `n` user-entered numbers
  - CheckFactorial.cpp: Calculates and prints the factorial of a given number (loop learnt from textbook)
  - CheckForLeapYear.cpp: Checks whether a given year is a leap year (practice conditional logic)
  - LargestOfThree.cpp: Determines the largest among three numbers
  - Palindrome.cpp: Checks if a 4-digit number is a palindrome using digit extraction and the ternary operator
  - SalaryCalculation.cpp: Calculates salary or related values (based on name)
  - SumOfDigits.cpp: Sums the digits of a number (digit extraction and arithmetic)
  - SwappingOfTwoNumbers.cpp: Swaps using both temp and temp-less logic
  - SwitchtCalculator.cpp:Calculator made using switch
  - BasicCalculator.cpp: Calculator made using ladder if else
  - ConsonantOrVowel.cpp: Consonant or vowel finder (Switch used)

- **Loops And Pattern**
  - EvenPrinting.cpp: Prints even numbers using loops
  - Factorial.cpp: Calculates factorial using loops
  - NumberPrinting.cpp: Number sequence printing (loop practice)
  - PatternPrinting.cpp: Classic pattern problems (rows, stars, etc.)
  - PrintingInRows.cpp: Prints data in formatted rows using nested loops
  - Reverse.cpp: Reverses number’s digits using loops
  - SumOfDigits.cpp: Computes sum of digits with loop and extraction

## Additional Achievements (Updated On: November 3, 2025)

- Solved 50+ C++ questions on HackerRank/CodeChef
- Consistent coding practice on competitive programming platforms
- Exploring DSA concepts, career scope, and their benefits for interviews
- Solved several teacher’s note problems; focused on revision and consistency
- Streak reset on 27 Sept; resumed daily practice and pushing code regularly
- Practiced Conditionals and for loop, made basic programs 
- Deepened loop and pattern printing skills for exam and competitive prep

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++
