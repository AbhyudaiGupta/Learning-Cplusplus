# C++ Learning Journey - BTech First Year

## About
This repository contains my C++ programming practice as a BTech First Year student, starting from basics and moving towards Data Structures and Algorithms.

## What's Inside
- **Learning-stage/** â€“ Basic C++ learning done via College Wallah with hands-on programs

## What I've Learned So Far

- âœ… Variables and constants
- âœ… Data types (int, float, double, char, bool)
- âœ… Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
- âœ… Arithmetic operations and expressions
- âœ… File I/O setup for competitive programming (`#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE`)
- âœ… Operator precedence and associativity
- âœ… Typecasting (int to float, char to int, implicit vs explicit)
- âœ… Mixed-type arithmetic (operations with int and float)
- âœ… Conditional statements (if, if-else, else if, ternary operator)
- âœ… Using ternary operator for compact checks
- âœ… Basic algorithms for palindrome, digit operations, and number comparison

## Programs Completed

- âœ… AreaOfCircle.cpp: Calculates area of a circle
- âœ… areaOfSquare.cpp: Calculates area of a square
- âœ… float.cpp: Demonstrates float operations
- âœ… SimpleIntrest.cpp: Calculates simple interest
- âœ… OddEven.cpp: Checks if a number is odd or even
- âœ… AbsoluteValue.cpp: Finds absolute value
- âœ… RoundOfMarks.cpp: Demonstrates rounding and truncation (float to int conversion)
- âœ… GradingSystem.cpp: Assigns grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F) based on marks with input validation
- âœ… TeamComparison.cpp: Compares two teams ("Dominator" vs "Everule") and prints the winner based on their scores
- âœ… 3numFight.cpp: Determines the largest among three numbers, handles all-equal and tie cases
- âœ… SumOfNumbers.cpp: Sums `n` user-entered numbers
- âœ… CheckFactorial.cpp: Calculates and prints the factorial of a given number (loop learnt from textbook)
- âœ… CheckForLeapYear.cpp: Checks whether a given year is a leap year (practice conditional logic)
- âœ… LargestOfThree.cpp: Determines the largest among three numbers.
- âœ… Palindrome.cpp: Checks if a 4-digit number is a palindrome using digit extraction and the ternary operator.
- âœ… SalaryCalculation.cpp: Calculates salary or related values (based on name).
- âœ… SumOfDigits.cpp: Sums the digits of a number (likely digit extraction and arithmetic).
- âœ… SwappingOfTwoNumbers.cpp: Implements both classic and temp-variable-free swapping methods.

## Additional Achievements ( Updated On: October 26, 2025 )

- Solved 15 C++ questions on HackerRank
- Consistently practicing coding on competitive programming platforms
- Explored the basics and future scope of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).Made notes on how DSA benefits problem-solving and coding interviews.
- Solved several conceptual and practice problems from teacher's notes.Reflected on the importance of consistency in coding and learning
- - Streak reset on 27 Sept, but my learning continues! Restarted daily practice and pushing code regularly.
- practiced programs on number logic (palindrome, digit sum, swapping, etc.)
- Practicing fundamentals for strong DSA and competitive programming prep

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: MinGW GCC

## Goals

- Master C++ basics
- Learn Data Structures
- Solve DSA problems
- Start competitive programming on CodeChef/HackerRank
