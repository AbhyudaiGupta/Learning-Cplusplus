# C++ Learning Journey - BTech First Year

## About
This repository contains my C++ programming practice as a BTech First Year student, starting from basics and moving towards Data Structures and Algorithms.

## What's Inside
- **Learning-stage/** - Basic C++ learning done via  College wallah with programs

## What I've Learned So Far

- âœ… Variables and constants
- âœ… Data types (int, float, double, char, bool)
- âœ… Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
- âœ… Arithmetic operations and expressions
- âœ… File I/O setup for competitive programming (#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE)
- âœ… Operator precedence and associativity
- âœ… Typecasting (int to float, char to int, implicit vs explicit)
- âœ… Mixed-type arithmetic (operations with int and float)
- âœ… Conditional statements (if, if-else, ternary operator)

## Programs Completed

- Area of Circle
- Area of Square
- Float operations
- Simple Interest Calculator
- Odd-Even Checker
- Absolute value calculator
- Rounding of Numbers (float to int conversion)

## Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: MinGW GCC

## Goals
- Master C++ basics
- Learn Data Structures
- Solve DSA problems
- Start competitive programming on CodeChef/HackerRank
