# C++ Learning Journey - BTech First Year

## About
This repository contains my C++ programming practice as a BTech First Year student, starting from basics and moving towards Data Structures and Algorithms.

## What's Inside
- **Learning-stage/** â€“ Basic C++ learning done via College Wallah with hands-on programs

## What I've Learned So Far

- âœ… Variables and constants
- âœ… Data types (int, float, double, char, bool)
- âœ… Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
- âœ… Arithmetic operations and expressions
- âœ… File I/O setup for competitive programming (`#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE`)
- âœ… Operator precedence and associativity
- âœ… Typecasting (int to float, char to int, implicit vs explicit)
- âœ… Mixed-type arithmetic (operations with int and float)
- âœ… Conditional statements (if, if-else, else if, ternary operator)

## Programs Completed

- âœ… AreaOfCircle.cpp: Calculates area of a circle
- âœ… areaOfSquare.cpp: Calculates area of a square
- âœ… float.cpp: Demonstrates float operations
- âœ… SimpleIntrest.cpp: Calculates simple interest
- âœ… OddEven.cpp: Checks if a number is odd or even
- âœ… AbsoluteValue.cpp: Finds absolute value
- âœ… RoundOfMarks.cpp: Demonstrates rounding and truncation (float to int conversion)
- âœ… GradingSystem.cpp: Assigns grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F) based on marks with input validation
- âœ… TeamComparison.cpp: Compares two teams ("Dominator" vs "Everule") and prints the winner based on their scores
- âœ… 3numFight.cpp: Determines the largest among three numbers, handles all-equal and tie cases
- âœ… SumOfNumbers.cpp: Sums `n` user-entered numbers

## Additional Achievements

- Solved 5 C++ questions on HackerRank (24 Oct 2025)
- Consistently practicing coding on competitive programming platforms


## Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: MinGW GCC

## Goals

- Master C++ basics
- Learn Data Structures
- Solve DSA problems
- Start competitive programming on CodeChef/HackerRank
